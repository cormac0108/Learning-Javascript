// objects are reference types in JS. A primitive type is defined by the programming language
// for example in JS we have undefined "hello" null false etc as primitives
// a reference type is created by the programmer.  creaing an array is just an object
// at the end of the day  so you are esentially creating a box that is a data structure


// context 
// context vs scope  - scope is created when it sees {} function ( ) {} example

function b ( ) {
    let a = 4;
}
console.log(a);   
// that is scope. og a wont work. 
// context tells you where we are within the object 




// instantiation
